Deep learning to predict blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) from ECG (QRS) and pulse oximeter signals.

The samples were taken every 125 Mhz. The two input and output signals have a duration of 10 seconds.

A comparative study with superficial NN, 1CNN and RNN (LSTM and GRU) has been proposed to evaluate the best approach.
